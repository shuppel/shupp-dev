## Technologies

- [Astro](https://astro.build) - The web framework for content-driven websites
- [Astro Content Collections](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/) - For content management
- CSS - Custom styling with modern CSS features
- JavaScript - For interactive elements

## Content Management System (CMS)

This site uses Astro Content Collections as a headless CMS for managing content. Here's how to use it:

### Content Types

The site supports the following content types:

1. **Blog Posts** (`/src/content/blog/`)
   - Markdown files for blog posts with frontmatter for metadata
   - Supported fields include title, description, publication date, categories, tags, etc.

2. **Projects** (`/src/content/projects/`)
   - Showcase your professional projects
   - Include details like technologies used, project dates, and links

3. **Author Profiles** (`/src/content/authors/`)
   - Store information about content authors (bio, social links, etc.)
   - Used across the site for attribution and about pages

4. **Roadmap Items** (`/src/content/roadmap/`)
   - Define future plans and track progress
   - Items can be marked as current, upcoming, or future
   - Basic items vs. phase items for different sections

5. **Principles** (`/src/content/principles/`)
   - Core guiding principles for development
   - Displayed on the roadmap page

6. **Credentials** (`/src/content/credentials/`)
   - Store professional certifications and credentials
   - Display badges and certifications on relevant pages

### Content Relationships

The CMS implements content relationships to create a cohesive information architecture:

- Roadmap items can be connected to phases via the `relatedRoadmapItems` field
- Blog posts can be connected to projects via the `relatedProjects` field
- Projects can link to related blog posts via the `relatedBlogPosts` field

These relationships allow for dynamic generation of related content sections throughout the site.
