## Mission

Full project lifecycle agentic frameworks and prompt libraries that utilize volitional action of agents to provide structured outputs via deliverables or downstream field generation via sub-agents. Creates reusable templates to accomplish complex tasks that may compound and complete other complex tasks down the road.

## The Volitional Deliverable F(x) Machine

The building block of the human-monitored Agent:

1. **User provides .yaml** (user configured)
2. **YAML configures XML** (prompt library provided)
   - Functions have detailed output specifications
3. **Runtime execution** via deliverables export
4. **Deployment** to user environments (manual/automatic)

## Core Manifesto

- **Version Control First**: Mutable, repeatable prompts from scratch with dynamic fields
- **Function-Like Interaction**: Inputs beget outputs in a predictable, machine-like manner
- **Generalized Templates**: Larger generalized templates over specialized ones
- **Work Breakdown Structure**: Complex outputs reduced to simple, manageable deliverables
- **Omni-Channel Vision**: Agents push to multiple environments seamlessly
- **Multi-Modal Approach**: Vision, auditory, speech, visuals, touch integration
- **Tested Libraries**: Version controlled prompt libraries over iterative MVPs
- **One-Click Orchestration**: Streamlined execution over continual prompting

## Linguistic Framework for Agent Design

### The Human-as-Machine Model

Understanding data structures in LLMs through linguistic structures, optimized for human language and communication patterns backed by neuroscience and biomimicry.

#### 1. Linguistic Components

- **Nouns** (Entities/Objects): Deliverables, knowledge bases, scopes, WBS components
- **Verbs** (Actions/Processes): Analyze, execute, refactor, optimize, deploy
- **Adjectives** (Properties/Verticals): Technical, architectural, strategic
- **Adverbs** (Modifiers): Iteratively, incrementally, collaboratively
- **Prepositions** (Relationships): Within scope, across teams, through processes
- **Interrogatives** (Questions): How, what, who, when, where, why

### 2. Brain-Computer Architecture Parallels

#### Volitional and Reflexive Synapses

Core Mappings:
- Working memory ↔ RAM (volatile, immediate access)
- Long-term memory ↔ Disk writes (persistent storage)
- Visual processing ↔ Graphics pipeline (hierarchical extraction)
- Motor cortex ↔ Action/Tool execution layer

**Key Insight**: Motor preparation as cache - the brain pre-computes movement patterns before execution, mapping directly to:
- Function call preparation in LLMs
- Tool-use priming through context
- Pre-computed responses for common patterns

### 3. Project Architecture

Projects as organized memory and action structures:

- **WBS as Brain Repository**: The things your brain composes to create volitional action
- **Configured Templates**: Runtime-ready plans called "Volitions"
- **Cascading Runbooks**: Volitions nesting into larger workflows
- **Dynamic Fields**: Self-configuring parameters for future runtimes

## Technical Implementation

### Configuration Pipeline

```yaml
# User-provided YAML
volition:
  name: "Project Scaffold"
  type: "development"
  outputs:
    - deliverable: "architecture_doc"
    - deliverable: "test_suite"
    - deliverable: "deployment_config"
```

### XML Prompt Library

Detailed function specifications with:
- Input parameters
- Processing logic
- Output schemas
- Error handling
- Multi-modal interfaces

### Deliverable Export

- Structured outputs to multiple environments
- Version-controlled artifacts
- Automated or manual deployment
- Cross-platform compatibility

## Use Cases

1. **Software Development**: Complete project scaffolding with architecture, tests, and deployment
2. **Content Creation**: Multi-format content generation with consistent voice
3. **Research Projects**: Structured research outputs with citations and analysis
4. **Business Process**: Automated workflow generation and optimization
5. **Educational Content**: Curriculum development with assessments and materials

## Integration Points

- **Version Control Systems**: Git, SVN for prompt library management
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Automated deliverable deployment
- **Project Management Tools**: JIRA, Asana integration for WBS
- **Documentation Systems**: Automated doc generation
- **Multi-Modal Platforms**: Voice, visual, and text interfaces

## Future Vision

Volition aims to bridge the gap between human intention and machine execution, creating a seamless flow from thought to deliverable through linguistically-optimized, neuroscience-backed agent frameworks that understand and replicate human cognitive patterns in project execution.
