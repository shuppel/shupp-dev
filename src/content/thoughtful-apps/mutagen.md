title: "Mutagen"
oneLiner: "Shape-shifting app that morphs API endpoints based on your needs using localized AI"
status: "concept"
category: "Developer Tools"
problem: "Apps are static and can't adapt to changing user needs. Developers need to anticipate every use case upfront, leading to bloated apps or missing functionality."
mainMockup: "https://www.tldraw.com/s/v2_c_example"
features:
  - name: "Dynamic API Morphing"
    what: "AI rewrites API endpoints on-the-fly based on usage patterns"
    why: "Apps can evolve without developer intervention"
    mockup: "https://www.tldraw.com/s/v2_c_example"
  - name: "Localized AI Engine"
    what: "On-device AI that learns from your specific needs"
    why: "Privacy-preserving personalization"

  - name: "Need Detection"
    what: "Monitors app usage to identify unmet needs"
    why: "Proactive feature generation"
userJourney:
  - "User tries to do something the app doesn't support"
  - "Mutagen detects the attempted action pattern"
  - "Local AI generates new API endpoint"
  - "App morphs to include new functionality"
  - "Feature persists if used repeatedly"
