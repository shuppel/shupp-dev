longBio: |
  As a product-focused engineering leader, I specialize in creating engaging, 
  user-centered digital experiences. My journey spans software development, 
  technical leadership, and product management—all driven by a passion for 
  solving complex problems with elegant solutions.

  I thrive at the intersection of design and engineering, building tools and 
  applications that not only work seamlessly but also feel intuitive and delightful 
  to use. My approach combines technical excellence with a deep understanding of 
  user needs and business objectives.

  With experience across various sectors including e-commerce, education, and SaaS, 
  I bring a versatile perspective to each project. I'm particularly interested in 
  building software that empowers people—whether they're creating content, learning 
  new skills, or connecting with others.

  When I'm not coding or sketching out new product ideas, you'll find me exploring 
  design systems, experimenting with new technologies, or contributing to the tech 
  community through mentorship and knowledge sharing.
