shortBio: Building apps for hoomans. Product manager and software engineer passionate about thoughtful digital experiences.
longBio: |
  I did things the opposite way—maybe the wrong way, but AI has kind of saved my ass. English Creative Writing undergrad, Technology Management masters, and I've been open source learning all my most technical skills in the midsummer of my career. What a fever dream LLMs have been.

  I'm somewhat of a unicorn in these spaces: a true product manager with technical aptitude, stopping short of a devtools PM (though I do strive for that). My unconventional path—from storytelling to technology—has given me a unique perspective on building products that actually matter to people.

  Based in Arlington, VA, I work at the intersection of hooman needs and technical possibilities. My approach is pragmatic: I use cloud technologies when necessary (despite my vendetta against their complexity and vendor lock-in), automate everything that makes sense, and focus on building things that genuinely improve people's lives.

  My work with Washington Rugby exemplifies this philosophy—transforming their digital infrastructure through strategic use of nonprofit resources, implementing zero-fee payment systems, and building automation that actually works. Not because it's technically impressive, but because it helps real people do real things better.

  But as we evolve in an age where houses are luxury items, we should not let our morals get away from us. Technology should serve humanity, not the other way around. This drives my work on Thoughtful App Co., where I design apps that respect users' time, attention, and humanity.

  The technical skills came later, learned through necessity and curiosity. The storytelling came first, and maybe that's why I can see through the tech industry's tendency to solve problems that don't exist while ignoring the ones that do.

  When I'm not wrestling with code or pondering product decisions, you'll find me running barefoot through Arlington (yes, really), contributing to open source projects, or playing rugby—activities that remind me that the best solutions are often the simplest ones.
