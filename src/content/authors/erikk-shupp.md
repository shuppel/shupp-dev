shortBio: Building apps for hoomans. Product manager and software engineer passionate about thoughtful digital experiences.
longBio: |
  I did things the opposite way—maybe the wrong way, but AI has kind of saved my ass from being irrelevant in the fourth generation tech evolution. English Creative Writing undergrad, Technology Management masters, and I've been open source learning all my most technical skills in the midsummer of my career. What a fever dream LLMs have been.

  I'm somewhat of a unicorn in these spaces: a true product manager with technical aptitude, stopping short of a devtools PM (though I do strive for that). My unconventional path—from storytelling to technology—has given me a unique perspective on building products that actually matter to people.

  The technical skills came later, learned through necessity and curiosity. The storytelling came first, and maybe that's why I can see through the tech industry's tendency to solve problems that don't exist while ignoring the ones that do. As we evolve in an age where houses are luxury items, we should not let our morals get away from us. Technology should serve humanity, not the other way around.

  Based in Arlington, VA, I work at the intersection of hooman needs and technical possibilities. My approach is pragmatic: I live for ideals echoed by the Ink and Switch team, live for O notation optimization, and hope to see all the big tech giants become swallowed by the sun. I use cloud technologies when necessary (despite my vendetta against their complexity and vendor lock-in), but always with an eye toward local-first alternatives.

  There's a bit of libertarian in the social justice in me—there is autonomy and accountability. Free markets should really be free (except fuck all predatory businesses). Technology should empower individuals, not trap them in walled gardens or surveillance capitalism.

  My work with Washington Rugby exemplifies this philosophy—transforming their digital infrastructure through strategic use of nonprofit resources, implementing zero-fee payment systems, and building automation that actually works. Not because it's technically impressive, but because it helps real people do real things better.

  Currently building apps for hoomans through Thoughtful App Co., where every concept starts with a real problem and ends with a solution that respects users' time and attention.
