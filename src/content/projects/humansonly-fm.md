Humans Only FM is a semi-anti-technology podcast exploring why humans should come first, technology second. The website serves as the home for all episodes, show notes, and the podcast's mission.

## Concept

In an increasingly synthetic world dominated by AI and automation, Humans Only FM takes a thoughtful stance on technology - not rejecting it entirely, but questioning when and how it serves human needs.

## Features

- Episode listings with show notes
- Links to major podcast platforms (Spotify, Apple Podcasts, YouTube)
- RSS feed for podcast subscribers
- Clean, minimal design reflecting the human-first philosophy

## Platforms

The podcast is available on:

- **Spotify**
- **Apple Podcasts**
- **YouTube**
- **RSS Feed**

## Technical Details

Built with Astro for fast, static site generation with minimal JavaScript overhead - fitting for a podcast that questions our over-reliance on complex technology.
