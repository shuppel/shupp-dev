After some thought and gradual rollout, I am starting to take the white papers and thought experiments and convert them into ideas. I think its definitely the time.

I did a search on android market place and the relationship management CRM on it is 100k downloads but like I can definitely beat that. I think there is a big market.

The next thing is really just understanding what it means to be human and launch the flag ships [Nurture](/thoughtful-app-co/nurture) and [JustInCase](/thoughtful-app-co/just-in-case). I felt these are blue ocean apps that would be the most helpful in the short term.

Meanwhile, there is a chance I can pull together the Onet API and build a fun oNet app as the mvp for the job app. All this and a few fleeting ideas.

But I think, kind of, we officially started doing **Thoughtful App Company** (TACo) stuff. Its not attached to anything but more and more each day it becomes real and becomes part of this interesting thought experiement.

I just need to understand to take these longer days slowly and really appreciate the in-between times. I often find myself in a traunch of tiredness or sleeplessness and really need to hit it hard on the Zzzs and family time-- until more cyber world, pushing off thoughts into the void.

Really need to start rereading these blogs and ideas I am pushing out, I think they are being hallucinated on LOL. The evils of improperly thorough prose. It is a crime against humanity.
