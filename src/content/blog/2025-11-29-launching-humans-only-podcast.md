Today I started the **Humans Only** podcast, which has its [pilot live now on Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6R5N9957YkGaSoAGyRnFeJ?si=3Yg8umgrRe64ONvPaazCQQ)—almost an hour long. 

The idea of a podcast is really a way of self-reflecting. It is a bit like music I am finding, so I had asked a friend in music if he'd be willing to help me. Using Riverside.fm, I was able to pull together the tools AND YES, the audio equipment as a musician comes in handy. You get a nice mic, a decent camera, and a stellar audio processing unit (analog) that boosts, compresses, eqs and bolsters your audio. It is quite awesome.

What I did not understand was the fact that the transcripts are something to live by. As someone who doesn't do a speaker circuit (I think I should try it soon) I see now that:
a) These are sometimes very heavily rehearsed talks.
b) These talks can go and go—they are not simply pontificated and executed on demand.

That is what I would do, but damn those *ums*, *ands*, and *uhhs* drag on when you reflect on them. So I am learning about how to be a better orator. I think the important thing is to really hyperfocus on the apperceptive parts of my brain to be able to self-reflect, improve and maybe take extra time to learn to "toast" without doing Toastmasters. I have the confidence and the acumen, hell even the mfing delivery, but definitely need to be more polished, refined... can be a McKinsey associate without the highway criminal fees.

For those reading: **Humans Only** podcast is on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6R5N9957YkGaSoAGyRnFeJ?si=3Yg8umgrRe64ONvPaazCQQ). It's the anti-technology technology podcast that examines emerging technology through different lenses and how to enable new technology to benefit humans.

I'm also reading a lot of hate from the EU and journalists regarding big tech. Social media, we know, is not very social. So how do you make technology more social? Well, you make it real.

I feel there is something maybe in the future called "degree of acquaintance"—maybe attached to Nurture as a feature—but basically your shared interests with a friend of a friend, where you can go on a blind hangout and discuss things. I have lots of thoughts on why social media fails. It fails the ultra successful people by making them plastic and it definitely fails the people on the other side of social success, who feel like they are in a pit of emptiness.

Meta supposedly shuttered a bunch of research of people not using Instagram and Facebook reporting better mental health and better metrics on happiness. I can see it. I stopped Instagram (I might need to pay someone to use it for me to let people know about my app, ironically) but I do feel less attached to the pulse of the hive mind. People need to relax.

Anyways—TLDR, **Humans Only!**
