Bachelor of Arts in English Creative Writing from Longwood University. This unconventional path for a technologist has proven invaluable in product management and software engineering, providing unique skills in storytelling, user empathy, and the ability to translate complex technical concepts into accessible narratives. The creative writing background enables me to see through the tech industry's tendency to solve problems that don't exist while ignoring the ones that do.
