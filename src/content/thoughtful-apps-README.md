## Status Definitions

- **ðŸ”µ Concept**: Just an idea, not actively being worked on
- **ðŸŸ¡ Exploring**: Researching feasibility and technical approach
- **ðŸŸ¢ Prototyping**: Actively building a proof of concept
- **âš« Shelved**: No longer pursuing (but keeping for reference)

## Creating TLDraw Mockups

1. Go to [tldraw.com](https://www.tldraw.com)
2. Create your mockup
3. Click Share â†’ Get Link
4. Use the share URL in the `mainMockup` or feature `mockup` fields

## Engagement Features

Each app page includes:
- **Voting**: Users can vote once per app (stored in localStorage, will upgrade to Lyket)
- **Comments**: GitHub-based discussions via Giscus
- **Email Capture**: "Notify me if built" feature
- **Price Sensitivity**: Users can indicate willingness to pay

## Configuration

To enable Giscus comments:
1. Update `src/components/GiscusComments.astro` with your GitHub repo details
2. Follow the [Giscus setup guide](https://giscus.app/)

To enable Lyket voting:
1. Sign up at [lyket.dev](https://lyket.dev)
2. Update the API key in `src/components/LyketVote.astro`

## Best Practices

1. **Be Specific**: Clearly define the problem and target audience
2. **Think Feasibility**: Be realistic about technical requirements
3. **User-Focused**: Always explain the "why" behind features
4. **Visual Mockups**: Include TLDraw mockups to make ideas tangible
5. **Open Questions**: Document unknowns and challenges
6. **Market Research**: Show you understand the competitive landscape
