The Rent vs Sell Calculator helps property owners make one of the most important real estate decisions: whether to keep a property as a rental or sell it now. This comprehensive tool analyzes cash flow, tax implications, and long-term wealth building potential.

### How It Works

1. **Enter Property Details**: Current value, mortgage balance, and original purchase information
2. **Estimate Rental Income**: Monthly rent, vacancy rate, and management costs
3. **Review Expenses**: Property taxes, insurance, maintenance, and HOA fees
4. **Analyze Results**: Compare projected net worth under both scenarios with detailed breakdowns

### Key Features

- **Cash Flow Analysis**: Monthly and annual rental income projections
- **Tax Optimization**: Depreciation benefits and capital gains calculations
- **Risk Assessment**: Considers vacancy, maintenance, and market volatility
- **Visual Comparison**: Interactive charts showing wealth accumulation over time

### Important Considerations

This calculator makes several assumptions you can adjust:
- Property appreciation and rent growth rates
- Investment returns if you sell
- Tax rates and depreciation recapture
- Property management and maintenance costs

### Tax Benefits of Rental Properties

When you rent out a property, you can deduct:
- Mortgage interest
- Property taxes and insurance
- Repairs and maintenance
- Property management fees
- Depreciation (typically over 27.5 years)

These deductions can significantly improve your after-tax returns compared to selling and investing the proceeds.
