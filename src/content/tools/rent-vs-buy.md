## About This Tool

The Rent vs Buy Calculator helps you make one of life's biggest financial decisions: whether to rent or buy a home. Based on the acclaimed New York Times calculator, this tool considers all the hidden costs and benefits of both options.

### How It Works

1. **Enter Property Details**: Input the home price, your down payment, and mortgage terms
2. **Add Rental Information**: Provide current rent and expected annual increases
3. **Include Additional Costs**: Property taxes, HOA fees, maintenance, and insurance
4. **Review Results**: See a detailed breakdown and visual chart showing when buying becomes advantageous

### Key Features

- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Factors in opportunity cost, tax benefits, and inflation
- **Visual Breakeven Point**: Interactive chart shows exactly when buying beats renting
- **Sensitivity Analysis**: Adjust assumptions to see how changes affect the outcome
- **Save & Share**: Generate a unique URL to save or share your calculation

### Assumptions

This calculator makes several assumptions that you can adjust:
- Investment returns on money not used for down payment
- Home price appreciation rate
- Inflation rate
- Length of time you plan to stay

### About the Original

This calculator is inspired by the New York Times' excellent Buy vs. Rent Calculator, reimplemented as an open-source tool with modern web technologies.
