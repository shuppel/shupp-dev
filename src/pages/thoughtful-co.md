## White Papers

**Why?**  
Major tech companies have shaped the digital landscape, but often at the expense of user autonomy, privacy, and wellbeing. Here's a closer look at the issues with each:

- **Google:**  
  Dominates search, email, and mobile OS markets, collecting vast amounts of personal data for targeted advertising. Their services are deeply integrated, making it difficult to opt out, and their algorithms can reinforce filter bubbles and surveillance capitalism.

- **Meta (Facebook):**  
  Designs platforms to maximize engagement, often at the cost of mental health and social cohesion. Data harvesting, manipulation of news feeds, and the spread of misinformation are persistent issues, as is the erosion of privacy.

- **Microsoft:**  
  Maintains proprietary ecosystems that lock users into their software and services. Aggressive data collection in Windows, forced updates, and opaque telemetry practices undermine user control and transparency.

- **Amazon:**  
  Centralizes e-commerce, cloud computing, and digital content, often undercutting small businesses and exploiting labor. Their surveillance of consumer habits and aggressive expansion threaten competition and privacy.

- **Tinder:**  
  Gamifies dating, encouraging addictive swiping behaviors and superficial connections. Monetizes loneliness and personal data, while fostering a culture of disposability in relationships.

- **LinkedIn:**  
  Turns professional networking into a data-mining operation, promoting self-branding and constant careerism. The platform's algorithms can reinforce echo chambers and prioritize engagement over genuine connection.

- **Apple:**  
  Markets itself as privacy-focused, but enforces a walled garden that limits user freedom and repairability. High prices, proprietary standards, and tight control over hardware and software restrict user choice and foster digital dependency.
