I want to implement a more cohesive design specification. Her: are the specifications I need you to implement across the entire site.

utilize a liquid design (described below):

# [FLOW LIKE WATER, ADAPT LIKE NATURE]

# Liquid Design Paradigm

## 1. Prompt Architecture

* **Intent Declaration**: Create fluid, adaptive interfaces with organic animations that respond naturally to user interaction and viewport changes
* **Constraint Parameters**: Animations must not exceed 300ms for responsiveness; fluid layouts must maintain readability at all viewport sizes
* **Reference Context**: Refer to natural movement patterns like water ripples, leaf movements, and other organic behaviors
* **Edge Case Handling**: Define graceful degradation for older browsers or low-power devices
* **Evaluation Metrics**: Measure perceived smoothness, animation frame rates (target: 60fps), and time-to-interactive

## 2. Design Constants

* **Brand Compliance**: Use gradients and transparency to enhance liquid feel while maintaining brand color palette; typography should have adequate spacing for dynamic layouts
* **Technical Requirements**: Implement will-change for animation optimization; use CSS physics-based animations when possible; responsive breakpoints must support fluid resizing not just discrete jumps
* **Accessibility Standards**: Animations must respect prefers-reduced-motion; all fluid elements must maintain WCAG AA contrast ratios throughout transformations
* **Implementation Boundaries**: Core liquid behaviors must work without JavaScript dependencies, with JS enhancements as progressive features

## 3. Decision Framework

* **Binary Decision Trees**:
  * If viewport < 600px → simplify liquid animations 
  * If user has reduced motion preferences → switch to subtle transitions
  * If element has focus → maintain stability during liquid animations
  
* **Priority Hierarchies**:
  1. Performance and responsiveness
  2. Natural, organic feel
  3. Visual richness and depth
  4. Animation complexity

* **Progressive Enhancement**:
  * Core: Basic fluid layouts with simple transitions
  * Enhanced: Physics-based animations and complex liquid behaviors
  * Premium: Interactive fluid simulations that respond to user input
* **Fallback Strategy**:
  * WebGL animations → fallback to CSS animations → fallback to simple transitions

## 4. Comprehensive Rubric

### Fluidity (1-5)
* 1: Static layouts with abrupt transitions
* 3: Smooth transitions but with mechanical feel
* 5: Truly organic movement that mimics natural fluid dynamics

### Responsiveness (1-5)
* 1: Layout breaks or animations stutter during resizing
* 3: Maintains layout but with noticeable recalculation
* 5: Seamlessly adapts like a liquid filling its container

### Performance Impact (1-5)
* 1: Significant frame drops or layout thrashing
* 3: Occasional frame drops during complex animations
* 5: Maintains 60fps across all animations and transitions

### Natural Feel (1-5)
* 1: Mechanical and artificial movement
* 3: Somewhat natural but with noticeable programmatic patterns
* 5: Indistinguishable from natural fluid movement

### Cohesive System (1-5)
* 1: Liquid elements feel disconnected from overall design
* 3: Consistent liquid elements but not fully integrated
* 5: Complete liquid design language that extends throughout the interface

## 5. Validation Protocol

* **Testable Assertions**:
  * All animations maintain 60fps on mid-range devices
  * Layouts reflow without content jumps when resized
  * Liquid transitions complete within 300ms

* **User Testing Requirements**:
  * Measure emotional response to fluid animations
  * Test perceived performance versus actual performance
  * Validate that liquid elements enhance rather than distract from content

* **Iteration Triggers**:
  * Performance drops below 45fps on target devices
  * User feedback indicating motion sickness or discomfort
  * Accessibility audits revealing motion-related issues

* **Documentation Standards**:
  * Document physics parameters for all liquid animations
  * Provide implementation examples across different viewport sizes
  * Include performance optimization guidelines specific to liquid elements
